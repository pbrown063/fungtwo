# WTFUNG

An approachable workflow interface to simplify mycellium farming data entry.

This software is designed to handle a mushroom farming workflow based off 
Brian Callow's model at [What The Fungus](http://www.wtfmushrooms.ca/).  There are several steps in his
production cycle:

  1. Plating cultures using samples stored in test tubes
  2. Splitting test plates into jars
  3. Sporing multiple bags using each jar 
  4. Inoculating blocks with the culture from the bags
  5. Loading the blocks into greenhouses 
  6. Harvesting the fruiting mycellium from greenhouses
  
This software uses standard web forms at each step to record pertinent
information.  There is an underlying data structure and code base that 
will be detailed in the [Developer manual](#).  The [User manual](#) will give 
basic instructions on how to use the software as a Mushroom farmer.  This 
data will be processed in order to give a big picture view of what is 
happening in the production cycle over seasons and years.
